# Sales Board/Sceen
A very simple web app to show sales results and make them editable for anyone with access to the interface (in other words: there is no access control built into the app).

##Features
* Foolproof: edit sales data by clicking the number you want to change
* Seamless: data is saved and retrieved with asynchronous requests
* Failsafe: daily backup of sales data through logrotate (see data/logrotate.config)
